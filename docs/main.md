# $\TeX \texttt{nik}$ Website
This website is an item organizer and storage holder application. This website has been created with the explicit use-case of the SaTyR-$\TeX \texttt{nik}$ association storage system. This means it is two web applications in one.

## Storage/Item Organizer
The first case of our web application is that of organizing the equipment of the storage area. This means a thorough itemizer that shows the current stock of our equipment, a system to handle requests for more stock/new stock, a system to change statuses of individual items and lastly a smart dashboard with graphs to clearly easily see how much stock we has, given the categories.

## Documentation/Software Storage
The second case of our web application is that of containing self-made documentation and software. Currently the way we are storing these is a scattered mess with no real home. The hope of this application is to remove the uncertainty of having to look for documentation/software and instead create a place where all of our association can get the information/software they need. This will hopefully make it easier for the future generation of $\TeX \text{nikkere}$. This is just a secondary effect of the website. The main goal is still the first case.
